# My_portfolio
Some of my main projects via Computer Vision

# 1-project-.-Gender-detection project.(male,female)
LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
frameworks : Tensorflow==2.5,,OpenCV
libraries used:,Numpy,Keras
Description:
- For this project I have classified overall 56,000 images to identify a gender of people from different races.
- Intially images were relabelled using one hot encoding
- I have built a model using Convolution Neural Networks
- I have used cvlib library - a very effective library for face detection
- The accuracy rate is about 96% on average.
- This model can be used for many purposes such as public security,statistics and so on.

# 2-Corona detection project using chest xray images
  LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
  frameworks : Tensorflow==2.5,,OpenCV
  libraries used:,Numpy,Keras
 - The data I have used includes the healthy and infected people's chest xrays.
 - In this project I have used a small amount of data but the accuracy level is high.
  Because I have used data augmentation function to multiply the nuimber of images by 
  rotating every images as to get  different images.
 - Using CNN have increased the efficiency of tests

# 3 - the possibility of Heart attack
 LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
 frameworks : Pytorch,
 libraries used:Numpy
 - I tried to predict heart attack risk at  different ages and health conditions
 - The Model relies on Linear Regression function on Pytorch
 - Optimizer Adam and activation function sigmoid is very helpful to classify the data
