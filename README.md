# My_portfolio
Some of my main projects via Computer Vision and Data Science


# 1.Gender-detection project.(male,female)
LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
frameworks : Tensorflow==2.5,,OpenCV
libraries used:,Numpy,Keras
Description:
- For this project I have classified overall 56,000 images to identify a gender of people from different races.
- Intially images were relabelled using one hot encoding
- I have built a model using Convolution Neural Networks
- I have used cvlib library - a very effective library for face detection
- The accuracy rate is about 96% on average.
- This model can be used for many purposes such as public security,statistics and so on.
Souce of code is here:

# 2.Corona detection project using chest xray images
  LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
  frameworks : Tensorflow==2.5,,OpenCV
  libraries used:,Numpy,Keras
 - The data I have used includes the healthy and infected people's chest xrays.
 - In this project I have used a small amount of data but the accuracy level is high.
  Because I have used data augmentation function to multiply the nuimber of images by 
  rotating every images as to get  different images.
 - Using CNN have increased the efficiency of tests

# 3.The possibility of heart attack
 LANGUAGES USED : Python 3.9v,
 frameworks : Pytorch,
 libraries used:Numpy
 - I tried to predict heart attack risk at  different ages and health conditions
 - The Model relies on Linear Regression function on Pytorch
 - Optimizer Adam and activation function sigmoid is very helpful to classify the data
 - here is a code : https://github.com/Mukhriddin19980901/My_portfolio/blob/main/heart%20cancer%20rate%20(1).py
 here is a link to see the difference of loss and accuracy

 # 4 Tashkent_housing_prediction_of_prices
 
 #Tashkent_houses_price_prediction

-Predictions of  accomodation prices in Tashkent city ,Uzbekistan

-The model worked with above 90%  accuracy rate.
-Matplotlib is a common library to visualize the data and the results.
